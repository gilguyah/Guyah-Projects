The BoS were fully aware that the Enclave were more advanced than they were. It was mentioned multiple times in the story's dialog. The dialog was especially emphasized right before the Battle of Project Purity. The Enclave's technological advantage was a main point of the BoS's weakness against them. Even the Enclave armor in-game had better armor stats than the T-51b armor set.

769571,1,You monster!,ThroAwayToRuleThemAl,WritingPrompts,2,2,0,2015-04,2015-04-27 04:51:28,"[NSFW] In 400 years I have yet to tire of this ability. Why this is happening to me I have no idea. I'm no saint or do gooder. Quite the opposite. For centuries I have been able to indulge myself in all sorts of decadence. The best part is, it usually always results in me being killed by someone else. Emotions are such a great thing. They make people act without thinking of the consequences. I had a few close calls over the years. My closest was about 30 years ago. I was caught and imprisoned in solitary confinement. I actually nearly killed myself. However the feeling was different than when someone else kills me. When someone kills me I feel a connection. As I lay dying I can feel a strange transfer begin to take place. But when I tried to hang myself in my cell I felt darkness. Thankfully one of the guards heard my flailing and cut me down. At the infirmary I attacked the nurse and grabbed an instrument to attack the guards with. I walked out of the front door after finishing my shift that night. There was also one other tidbit that came with this ability. I can't be sure but if I kill someone they take over my ability and I die. I nearly killed someone once. I actually had to save their life to prevent the swap. But instead of me taking their body, I began to feel me slipping away and being taken over. That must have been what happened to me. But the man who killed me was in such a rage after what I had done he either did not care or did not know. And now I sit here, waiting on a street corner for the school bus to arrive. I have been in this body for far too long. I don't particularly like going above 40. I have been scoping out my next body for months. I usually go for men because that is what I was born. Being a woman is fun but strange. Just too weird for me but I can deal with it in a pinch. But this one was prized. He was very good looking and athletic. The parents were loaded and rarely ever home. Shitty marriage but together for the kids type of thing. I made sure to bring my gun loaded with the safety off. They hurt less usually. Knife pain is sharp and never ending it seems. Not until I die and transfer bodies. I wait till the bus stops at the corner. I watch as all the middle school kids get off the bus until I see her. Little 11yr old Sarah. I walk up to her nonchalantly as the bus pulls away. ""Hi Sarah, I'm Mitch, I'm a friend of your fathers. He had to go out of town on business so he asked if I could pick you up and bring you home."" I say. She looks at me a little apprehensively and smiles. ""Ok"" she says as she walks with me to my car. I guess being in a business suit and driving a nice car helps to sell it. We pull up to her house and walk to the doorway. I pull out my keys and say ""Oh crap, I forgot the key your dad left for me. Do you have a key to get in?"". ""Yep"" she says and continues ""My daddy gave them to me since I'm old enough now to let myself in. But I usually just walk home, why did he have you pick me up?"". Smart little brat eh. ""Oh well there has been a few break-ins lately and he's been a little worried about you going home by yourself. He just wanted me to stay until your brother got home"". She just smiled and opened the door. She immediately heads up stairs to her room and as she turns to go down the hallway to her room I slowly follow. I reach her room, and open the door. She turns to say something to me but she sees me pull the gun out and stops. I place the gun on her dresser by the door and begin to disrobe. ""We have an hour until your brother gets home and I get to enjoy every second of it. And then many more years after that""."

But obviously we have to make driving drunk illegal, because most people are WAY more dangerous behind a wheel when they're drunk. It's not practical to run some sort of safety test on every person that gets in a car, drunk or sober. Instead we make a hard rule that's easy to implement. You're not legally allowed to drive drunk ever. This bleeds into our moral opinion of it. The same goes for pedophilia and bestiality. The notion of consent is really blurry. Morally, is it possible for an 8 year old to consent, and be happy with that choice for the rest of his/her life? Of course. Lots of people throughout history have had sex (consensual, coerced or otherwise) at young ages and haven't been ""damaged"" by it (whatever that means). However, in this type of relationship, it's way more likely that a person will heavily coerce an 8 year old to do things that they are not comfortable with, and will likely have an effect on them in the future. It's also very easy for a person to convince a child to lie about it later, either through intimidation, or more complicated psychological means ""You liked it didn't you, because you like playing? And sometimes playing hurts, but really you like it"". Same goes for bestiality, it's way more likely that a person just makes an animal do something it doesn't want to do than it is that the animal would actually want to do it. And it's even more likely that a person would lie on an animals behalf later on (though bestiality is a weird one, because we have problem with the animal doing something it doesn't want to, yet we happily corral, force our will upon animals, force mate, and kill animals without problem). So in short, of course there are cases where it's completely moral, but it would be not reasonable to allow those cases legally because it would be too difficult to determine. Culturally the line between illegal and immoral gets blurred, so the same blanket beliefs get applied morally."

Soooo these happened a while back, but if they can make someone smile today, it's worth sharing right? First fuckup. I was scheduled to serve an evening shift, so I hit the gym beforehand. I realized too late, I forgot an extra pair of underwear. So I had to go commando, but that's no big deal. I've had to do it on multiple occassions. The problem is that I gained weight since I started that job. Aka, I had gained weight since buying the pants. In the middle of speaking with a nice elderly lady, my button popped. And my zipper slowly crawled it's way down. This lady had an entire conversation with me, not knowing that my peen was hanging out right next her face under my apron. I had awakened to my exhibitionism. Fuckup 2: I've always hated the taste of coffee. The drink, in candy, ice cream, didn't matter. Then my ex introduced me to starbucks. Oh my sweet jeezus, I was drinking that extra large, off-menu size every day. The problem is, she didn't tell lactose intolerant me that it had milk. And I never thought to inquire. After a week of that, it's mothers day. I'm super busy, can't catch my breath, and all of a sudden, I feel a great big fart. Go to the back to release the kraken, and I knew it was weird how it tore it's way out if my ass. But I was busy so I went straight back to work. End of my shift, I go to the bathroom to scratch an itchy butt, and it's mushy. I had continued working without realizing I had diarrhead in my briefs.

We have gone out roughly 10 times and we both have great times. We go out for dinner and drinks, just drinks, shes met my friends, and I've met hers twice. She made me dinner and drinks last night and it all went well. We tend to enjoy our alone time vs being with friends. We both have agreed on that. It feels like a girlfriend. Everything in that aspect seems to be perfect or damn near close. The problem is physical. After our third date she told me she had been raped before and that since that happened, a year and a half ago, she has not been able to be with a guy. She said even getting close to a guy has been really hard. I understood this, she has a damn good reason too. Not a deal breaker to me and I'm really not in a rush for any reason. I am willing to go forward, she said I could leave if I ever felt it to be much. I find her very attractive and shes suggested similar thoughts in regards to me. I have been patient but it has been about a month and she doesn't even let me give her hugs. I am not a gross or smelly person or anything of that sort. I've tried to kiss her but she was stand offish there as well. I honestly, even though it seriously sounds like it, don't think I am in the friend boat. Maybe I am blind? I mean if she wont give me a hug she has some problems with her past still constantly in her head. It is just a hug. I hug my friends male or female with no issues.. I am currently placing the problem to be on her past issues and her trying to get over it. I don't need the physical aspect TODAY. I want to be there for her, I find her mind even more attractive than what I see phsyically. I love to talk to her and just hang out etc, but eventually I think every healthy relationship needs the passion of a phsyical relationship. I guess the question is what do I do? I know I cant force her to speed up her recovery. It I think is too early for me to push her to talk about it or to talk to someone else about it. Anyone have any advice, or questions? I really am just lost on how to continue. Should I just friend her for now?"

It's a videogame. And its a pretty good one. I spent my 60 bucks and had about 200 hours of fun playing it, which is about 30 cents an hour. Damn good value. Since then I've had another 150 hours of fun playing the endgame, which is effectively free content provided by the developer. And now they're making the game even better. For free. They didn't have to do any of this. They could have just released the game and walked away. Which for the majority of the history of videogames is what happened. Release the game, people buy it, play it, finish it, and then move on with their life and go buy another one. If you want to see a broken game, Google ET on the Atari. That was a broken game. But now oooh nooo; people want the game to be as good as the best ever game in the genre, and will wail and gnash their teeth if it falls short. It's not a car. If I spend $25,000 on a car and the car is reasonably good but it's got some faults, then sure I want it fixed for free. But you didn't spend $25k on a car. You spent $60 on a video game. That's a nice pair of jeans or dinner for 2. But if I spend $60 on dinner and it's reasonably good, but not quite as good as the best meal I ever had, do I throw a hissy fit, demand not only that the meal is improved for free but that I also want them to fix it to my specifications and keep giving me free dessert for months? Oh, and that they should thank me for yelling at them? No I don't. Because I'm not 6 years old. I feel sorry for the devs. They work hard and produce a very good game (perfect? No. Very good? Yes), and also work hard to fix the problems that occur, and all they get is this kind of petulant and infantile abuse from people that want the moon on a stick. So, from me: thank you massive. Thank you for making a good game that I enjoy. Thank you for fixing the problems. Thank you for the extra free content. And I'm sorry that you have to put up with this drivel."

For starters, I'm part of that rare group of humans with what I'm coming to understand is an abnormally large penis. I'm big and tall and I've always known I was bigger then average. But now I'm kinda starting to feel like a bit of a freak. When hard I'm 9.5 inches long, and I don't know how big around, but to big to close my hand all the way around. Add to that, for personal reasons I won't go into here, I got a Prince Albert piercing. My last girl friend cheated on me with another dude, ruining my already poor self esteem. I now know she did it for the attention not the sex, but I can't help but think it's because she didn't like my dick. It doesn't help that she was always sore after sex though. To be clear, I'm an attentive partner. I enjoy going down on girls, and will generally get a girl off at least once before sex, because otherwise I don't really fit to easily. Now to the problem, my new gf is not that experienced and is pretty much just afraid of me. She's a great girl otherwise, but it's killing my self confidence even more. I take out the piercing when we are going to mess around because I know it just makes me look more intimidating. But it's as much just the size that scares her as anything else. The problem is that I know she's afraid I'll hurt her, and so I try to be extra careful and go extra slow. But then I can't stay hard enough to actually do anything. It's a vicious downward spiral. Between my past issues, scaring her, and not being able to stay hard for fear of hurting her, my self confidence is plummeting. And that makes it even more difficult to stay hard. It's to the point I'm thinking about giving up on sex because it just makes me feel worse. **TL;RD** My girlfriend is afraid of my big penis and it's killing my self esteem. What should I do."

Electricity is like water that has to flow from a source to a destination. When you plug in (or turn on) an item that draws a lot of electricity, it's like adding a new branch(the destination) to a river(the source). The new branch fills up with water from the rest of the river, and then the river replenishes itself from its own source. Also, while it's highly not recommended to plug things in this way, it's really not all that different from plugging a standard electrical plug into a wall. It just lacks the safety shielding around the exterior of the sockets. People seem to be under the impression that jamming wires into an electrical socket is going to cause some kind of explosion or something, which it wont - unless you have a gas leak in your house and the wires touch eachother, or something simliar. If the wires somehow DID touch eachother, the circut breaker would pop, you'd hear a snapping noise, and you'd get a little puff of smoke. No fires, no explosions.

No, seriously. There's some talk that the new Legend Rule is because Theros is going to have a Legendary theme (I think it may just be another bone thrown to Commander). If Theros is about Legends, this would have to wait. So, here's my idea. New Phyrexia is making its first attempted invasion--to a neighboring plane, Kamigawa. Since the original Mirrodin and Kamigawa were back to back, I don't think it would be stretching to say that they're situated next to each other in the Multiverse. Thematically, we'd have a few artifact creatures from Phyrexia, with the big story push being the effect of Glistening Oil corrupting the locals. An important caveat is that the Kami War is over, and both the spirits and mortals are living in peace again. This new threat would have them actively banding together against the invaders and their own fallen brethren. Mechanically, we reintroduce Splice, but as ""Splice Onto Instant"" or ""Splice Onto Sorcery,"" depending on color and the nature of the Splice spell (i.e., Sorceries splice onto other Sorceries). The second set will change things up, with Splice spells that splice onto opposites, and the third set can do some really crazy stuff like ""Splice Onto Enchantment,"" or multicolor Splice costs (i.e. 1U Instant with ""Target Creature gets +1/+1 and gains Flying this turn. 1W: Splice Onto Instant). This is thematically explained by the humans and Kami working together, blending their magics. Spiritcraft can be reworked as ""Whenever you play a Spirit or Splice Onto a Spell"" and probably be given an ability word. We can also see some non-spirits getting in on the act. Bushido would probably also come back, but that's really nothing to get excited about. However, we *could* get more Ninjas! And of course, there's the focus on Legends. I feel like there's a lot of ripe ideas here, both thematically and mechanically. On one side, we have Kamigawa, a land of larger-than-life heroes. On the other, we have Phyrexia, a world of nameless, faceless drones who exist almost solely as a collective. The second set could focus on the inevitable betrayal of New Phyrexia by their own Red faction, with the third set focusing on Kamigawa narrowly beating back the offensive and re-sealing the portals. It would also be a great excuse to revisit the Epic Mechanic. All this means that New Phyrexia will have learned a great deal about how to invade a Plane, and will be all the more deadly *next time.*"

We humans are a tribal primates. Our brains are very similar to what they were 50,000 years ago; biological evolution takes a long time. One consequence of this is tribalism, an instinct whereby an ""us"" group and a ""them"" group are created (with ""them"" being demonized). This is an animalistic instinct, it is very powerful and very dangerous. Many people go above our animalistic instincts because we can understand it with reason. Many other people however, for multiple reasons, do not. Racism is fundamentally an extension of this tribalism; it's categorizing other people as outside the in-group and demonizing and scapegoating them collectively, with little regard to the constituent individuals.

This gives you an extra token &amp; evasion for same cmc (even if more mana intensive). Lingering souls? If you cut this then you should not be playing tokens. Bitterblossom? It is arguably the best card in the deck. Timely reinforcements? Same cmc, but a blow out to burn, &amp; can really help swing the momentum if you are behind. Auriok champion? Helps prevent life loss, another turn two play, is great against jund... Really only dies to path, excellent synergy w worship in the sideboard. Any of the planeswalkers you mentioned? Then why play oath? Discard spells? Turn one thoughtseize or iok is where this deck likes to be, especially against decks like infect, affinity grishoalbrand, burn(iok not ts). Any of the removal? Path is one of the best removal spells in the format. murderous cut, dismember.... Usually a one of of each... Sometimes changed for a slaughter pact... Just the right amount of removal spells...usually 5-6 &amp; 6 discard spells are where you want to be. I guess what i am getting at is that oath is a cute card at best &amp; that while it does synergise well with cards in bw tokens, the list is pretty tight &amp; no card that would be cut is worse than oath."

The CM of Rajasthan planned to stay here today, so the place was flooded with BJP members. It's cool, it always happens and we're quite used to it. We avoid going out of our home during VIP visits so that we don't cause any inconvenience to the police as they have to check us every time. Anyway, today was Mom's appointment with doctor and she also had to go through some blood tests. I was about to call a cab but as soon as I come home, A car was blocking the way (I have the video too). I did a ""passing"" light signal on my bike and they didn't move. I kept honking but the car guy was talking to someone and just didn't move. I took out the phone and started recording, that's when someone told him I'm recording him and he moved. Then I move ahead a little and I saw the two cars in the way of my home. Even my bike couldn't go through. I parked my bike at my neighbour's and went near the cars. I tried to open the doors and slighly hit it to initiate an alarm, but there was no alarm. I turned on the flash with my phone, stood near the car and flashed it in all direction, hoping the owner will notice it and come, but no one came. Then I did what you're seeing in these pictures. Note: I could have written on the car with a permanent marker or just scratched it, but I didn't do that. It always happens when the CM arrives, I always tell these people not to park in front of my home and the typical response is ""Tere baap ka road hai kya?"". I was too pissed this time because it was my Mom who needed to see a doctor but couldn't. She has a serious liver infection and the doctor has told us to be ready for a surgery any time. She can't walk the distance and cab or any other car couldn't come because they were blocking the way. What if something bad would have happened? And this shit is happening with us who has tons of contacts and who are in touch with administration and national level politicians. What about the people who just die in silence?"

I kill both necromancers and start hitting the lever to hint him to activate it. After 30 seconds of hitting it and pointing to it twice, he got the hint and finally pulled it. Straight away I distracted the boss and threw knives at it, letting the host do some damage from behind. Sure enough he gets trampled by the rear legs. As it turns to face him, I get a couple of hits on him, only did around 200 damage. The host meanwhile, is throwing fire balls, which are doing 45 damage or something similar. At this point, the boss is down to less than 1/4 health and I decide to end it and cast flame swathe on him, in total I did probably around 25% of the total damage. I wave and bow then go back to my world, get a message from the host thinking its a ""thanks"" but no, its a voice message telling me I did too much damage for him to enjoy the boss fight and that I'm a fucking virgin fuck.

I read an interesting article months back about how Israel handles its airport security (in a country that deals with bombing and extremists daily.) No invasive scannings, no digging through every passenger's luggage, no removing of the shoes - they train their security to read people for signs of nervousness and anxiety, and engage people by asking them questions. Instead of being invaded physically, they send you through many checkpoints of being questioned. Much more efficient. Oh, and they have armed guards visible EVERYWHERE. Rifles at the ready.

The largest amount of death from terrorism happened in America hundred George W. Bush on September 11, 2001. Racial relations definitely need some work here in America, but to say that they are a pre-1960 level is preposterous. Before 1960, blacks couldn't even ride in the same part of the city bus, Black children went to different schools and then there white neighbors. And interracial marriage Michigan legal in the majority of states...come on"

I was watching Futurama a couple of nights ago, and it was the episode where Nibbler makes Fry detonate a bomb inside a giant all-knowing brain to save the universe. That episode gets me thinking whenever I watch it. If you could ask any question imaginable and receive the 100% objective truth, what would happen if you asked it if God is real? I mean, we can say that we believe in Him, and we would all like to think the answer is yes. But if you were in that situation, would you want to know the answer? What if the answer you got back was just... no? I know it would be hard to determine since there's no Biblical contingency rule regarding huge infinitely-intelligent brains, but would God even approve of you asking a question like that? If I heard ""yes"", my faith would be perfect, unquestionably. But I think that goes against the idea of faith - leaping around a blind corner (Spyro 3, Dino Mines); investing everything you have in a stock that may not be profitable. I've heard theories saying that our life on earth is a test to see who is worthy of entering God's kingdom, by giving us difficult tests of faith on earth to find out who has true faith. Could having a definitive answer on God's existence spoil His plan? What are your thoughts?"

Also, I never stack weights, it just makes it easier for them to fall off the car.

I mean, I have seen countless posts saying every issue AMD has with its cards is the fault of someone else; literally would be like BMW blaming BP or Shell for diesel emissions. Do we blame Hynnix for AMD's crap memory controllers in their processors? Does the fact that AMD has been using Global Foundries since 2006 not show that they have an established fabrication agreement? We can't act like AMD is the victim here because they decided to push forward with the manufacture a product that (even if their intent was to make a better card) if lack luster. I am all for AMD creating a competitive GPU because complacency breeds failure and though AMD APUs are pretty competitive, it is clear that since their acquisition of ATI they have really been falling out of touch with what is needed to innovate their GPU branch. AMD pushed a less than attractive product and we do not like it; that is fine. But seriously, can we stop making excuses?"
